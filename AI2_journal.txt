Week2:
This week I used AI for the Week2 excercises. I mainly used it to claify syntax when working with 
for and while loops. I forgot in which cases it would be best to use either a for or while loop and so
I asked ChatGPT for clarification. I also used AI to help with understanding the syntax structures of 
conditionals. For example, I had a habit of writing if statements with parentheses, but I forgot that 
in Python you don't need to put the conditional in parentheses. I also struggled a bit with question 
#26 and asked ChatGPT for clarification if this question implied that I could create shelf a and b on my own.
