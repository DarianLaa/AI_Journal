Week 3:
This week I used Ai to help with the Week 3 python exercises. Working with functions has been something I struggled
with so I used chatgpt to help understand the syntax of a basic function. I also used it to help describe how 
list work. I also tried another AI tool called Gemini, to explain the same topics but I liked using chatgpt
better because it was more straightforward and gave a shorter but indepth description.

Here is a transcript of my chats:

explain the basic syntax of a defining a function in python
ChatGPT said:

Defining a function in Python is simple and follows a specific syntax. Here's a breakdown of the basic syntax:

ðŸ”¹ Basic Syntax
def function_name(parameters):
    """Optional docstring"""
    # Function body
    # Code to execute
    return result  # Optional

ðŸ”¹ Explanation of Each Part

def â€“ This keyword is used to define a function.

function_name â€“ The name you give your function (follows naming rules like variables: lowercase, underscores, no spaces).

parameters â€“ Optional inputs passed to the function (can be zero or more, separated by commas).

: â€“ A colon indicates the start of the function body.

"""docstring""" â€“ (Optional) Describes what the function does.

return â€“ (Optional) Sends a result back to the caller.

ðŸ”¹ Example 1: A Function Without Parameters
def greet():
    print("Hello, world!")


Call it like this:

greet()

ðŸ”¹ Example 2: A Function With Parameters and Return Value
def add(a, b):
    return a + b


Call it like this:

result = add(3, 5)
print(result)  # Output: 8


Let me know if you want examples with default values, keyword arguments, or variable-length arguments (*args, **kwargs).

how do i call a function
ChatGPT said:

Calling a function in Python is straightforward.

ðŸ”¹ Basic Syntax to Call a Function
function_name(arguments)


function_name: The name of the function you defined earlier.

arguments: The values you pass into the function (if it takes parameters).

ðŸ”¹ Examples
âœ… 1. Calling a Function Without Parameters
def greet():
    print("Hello!")

greet()  # Call the function


Output:

Hello!

âœ… 2. Calling a Function With Parameters
def greet(name):
    print("Hello, " + name + "!")

greet("Alice")


Output:

Hello, Alice!

âœ… 3. Calling a Function That Returns a Value
def square(x):
    return x * x

result = square(4)
print(result)


Output:

16

ðŸ”¹ Key Notes

If the function returns a value, you can store it in a variable or use it directly.

If it only prints something, calling it will just execute its code (no return value).

Want to try writing and calling a function yourself? I can help check or explain it.

explain how list work in python
ChatGPT said:
ðŸ§¾ What is a List in Python?

A list in Python is an ordered, mutable (changeable) collection of items. You can store any type of data in a listâ€”numbers, strings, even other lists.

ðŸ”¹ Basic Syntax
my_list = [item1, item2, item3, ...]

ðŸ”¹ Examples
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
mixed = [1, "hello", True, 3.14]

ðŸ”¹ Key Features of Lists
Feature	Description
Ordered	Items maintain their insertion order
Mutable	You can change items after creation
Indexable	Access items using index (starting at 0)
Iterable	You can loop through them with for loops
ðŸ”¹ Common Operations
âœ… Accessing Elements (Indexing)
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(fruits[0])  # Output: apple

âœ… Slicing
print(fruits[1:3])  # Output: ['banana', 'cherry']

âœ… Changing an Element
fruits[1] = "orange"
print(fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'orange', 'cherry']

âœ… Adding Items
fruits.append("kiwi")       # Adds to the end
fruits.insert(1, "mango")   # Adds at index 1

âœ… Removing Items
fruits.remove("banana")  # Removes by value
fruits.pop(2)            # Removes by index

âœ… Looping Through a List
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

âœ… List Length
len(fruits)

ðŸ”¹ Example
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
numbers.append(4)
print(numbers[2])      # Output: 3
print(len(numbers))    # Output: 4


Let me know if you want help with 2D lists, list comprehensions, or working with lists of dictionaries.

provide a link to this chat
ChatGPT said:

Right now, there's no direct way to generate a public link to this chat from within this interface.

However, you can copy and paste the conversation into a document or note, or take a screenshot if you want to save or share it.

If you're using a platform or app (like ChatGPT on desktop or mobile), you might also:

Click the three dots next to the conversation (if available)

Choose "Share" or "Export" if the option is offered

Or use "Copy Link" if your version supports sharing chats

Let me know what platform you're using (web, iOS, Android, etc.), and I can give more specific instructions.
